The missing php uptime package inspired by
python module [uptime](https://pythonhosted.org/uptime/#module-uptime). No stable release yet!

> This package aims to provides a **cross platform** PHP API — OO and functional — that tells you
> how long your system has been up and when it booted. This turns out to be surprisingly
> non-straightforward, but not impossible on any major platform.
